In this Project we estimate the state of the bus of a
power system. We took data from the system. it is difficult to execute
it properly in the short time span because of understanding
the real time time monitoring of such a dynamic system. Error
comes with this analysis due to limitation in measurement. In this
state estimation we actually calculate the state of a certain bus.
The state of a bus defined by actually by their Voltage Magnitude
and angle in the system bus. Our Data accesible b the SCADA
system. It is done for IEEE 14 and 27 Bus.
